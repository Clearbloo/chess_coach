# Chess Coaching Software Architecture Design

## System Overview

The Chess Coach software is designed as a modular application that analyzes a user's chess games, identifies strengths and weaknesses, provides personalized feedback, and generates targeted practice exercises. The architecture follows a component-based design to ensure maintainability, extensibility, and separation of concerns.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is structured into the following major components:

1. **Core Engine** - The central component that coordinates all other modules and manages the application flow.
2. **User Profile Manager** - Handles user data, preferences, and progress tracking.
3. **Chess Engine Interface** - Provides chess move validation and position evaluation.
4. **Game Analysis Engine** - Analyzes chess games to identify patterns, strengths, and weaknesses.
5. **Feedback Generator** - Creates personalized feedback based on analysis results.
6. **Practice Module** - Generates customized exercises targeting specific improvement areas.
7. **Data Storage** - Manages persistent storage of user data, games, and analysis results.
8. **User Interface** - Provides interactive visualization and user interaction capabilities.
